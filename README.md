# AI Workflow & AI Agent (Learning Project)

This repository contains an **experimental AI workflow and AI agent**
created as part of my learning journey into AI systems.

The goal of this project is not to build a production-ready solution,
but to understand how different AI components fit together.

## What this includes
- A basic AI agent
- An n8n workflow connecting the agent with supporting logic
- Hands-on experimentation with AI workflows

## Tools explored
- n8n
- OpenAI (LLMs & embeddings)
- Vector database (Pinecone)

## Notes
- This project is for **learning purposes only**
- Configurations may change as I continue learning
- Shared to document progress and understanding
